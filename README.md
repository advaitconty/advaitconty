# Hello there!
I'm Advait, an active member of [Hack Club](https://github.com/hackclub), a coder, designer and physics lover

P.S.: All the app icons and banners are designed by me, in Figma!

## Swift
- [FitStreak](https://github.com/contyadvait/gymguru) - A fitness tracker based in SwiftUI and a project made part of the [Swift Accelerator Programme](https://swiftinsg.org)

- [Verdi](https://github.com/contyadvait/environment-app) - An emissions tracking app that helps you track your carbon emissions (not on app store yet)

- [Solstice](https://github.com/contyadvait/Solstice) - A pomodoro timer that has a brutal focus on aesthetics and minimalism

## Python
- [QMLoaner](https://github.com/contyadvait/QMLoaner) - A school app that I co-developed with a friend in Python to help automate boring tasks such as form creations and returning guitars, for the school Guitar Ensemble CCA

- [Moods](https://github.com/contyadvait/moods) - A custom music player built in Python that runs on "Moods", which invovles an iOS app and a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W repurposed to run as a portable music player

- [Tetris: The Tetris Trap](https://github.com/contyadvait/tetris-the-tetris-trap) - My submission for Counterspell Globals - it's basically Tetris with a twist at the end!
